Things to work on in future:

##token count feature:
Add cumulative token (input/output/total) tracking over the session.
We already show token use per api call but could be good to also track over the session too.

## session logging feature:
Log session (context, tokens, etc) to a file. Perhaps as a flag on the command
(or default behavior that can be turned off).

## retry request on request error:

We sometimes see roboc exit when a request fails, like this:

Great! Let me re-read and verify Step 2 is complete:
calling tool: grep_files with args: {"pattern": "fn grep_files_decoder", "context": 12}
Request error: error making request

We should both try to log more diagnostics for when this happens and add a retry or two before giving up.
